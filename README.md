# Image List Maker

This repository is archived and read-only.

See [gencg-exported-image-group](https://github.com/leeye51456/gencg-exported-image-group), which achieves the original objective of this repository. It reads multiple TGA image files from GenCG, convert them to PNG/JPEG, and then combine them as PDF with page numbers.
